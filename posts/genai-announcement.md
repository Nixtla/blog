### Introduction:

Time series are everywhere : It powers decisions in energy, finance, retail, and beyond. The rise of foundation models has revolutionized how we approach time series problems, making it faster and more accessible than ever. Despite recent advancements, the field still needs a unified ecosystem that brings together multiple foundation models, understands natural language, and reasons about data seamlessly — and that’s exactly what we’re bringing to life at Nixtla.

At Nixtla, we saw an opportunity to build an ecosystem where models, agents, and time series intelligence work together seamlessly.

## Introducing Nixtla MCP:

At the core of this launch is Nixtla MCP, our system designed to bring intelligence and interoperability to time series forecasting and analysis. We’re excited to introduce two major capabilities now available through the Nixtla MCP:

1. **Access multiple foundation models directly from NixtlaClient:** You can now work with models such as TimeGPT, Chronos, and TimesFM, all from a single, unified interface. This makes it effortless to experiment across models, compare performance, and select the best one for your use case — without switching tools or managing separate integrations.
2. **Run full analytical workflows automatically:** Nixtla MCP provides essential time series knowledge and a fully integrated execution environment, enabling agents to reason about data, generate code, run analysis, and refine results. It empowers your AI agent to not just understand your instructions, but act on them — bridging the gap between intelligence and execution in time series workflows.

## Real-World Results:

We have been testing these tools through the [VN1 competition](https://www.datasource.ai/en/home/data-science-competitions-for-startups/vn1-forecasting-accuracy-challenge-phase-1/description), where Nixtla MCP demonstrated their capability to autonomously generate and refine forecasting solutions. With only a basic research plan as guidance, the system achieved first place, outperforming the original competition winner and subsequently published solutions. This showcases how the combination of intelligent control and multi-model access can fully leverage the power of foundation models for time series tasks.

## Looking Ahead:

This launch marks a new chapter in Nixtla’s mission: building an autonomous time series ecosystem where anyone can explore, forecast, and make decisions effortlessly. Nixtla MCP is just the beginning. Together, they set the foundation for a future where time series intelligence is not only automated but truly adaptive.
